The Book Recommendation System is designed to provide personalized book recommendations based on user preferences and interactions.
The Book Recommendation System effectively utilizes cosine similarity to provide personalized book recommendations based on user data. By integrating the system into a Flask-based web application, users can interact with the system through a user-friendly interface. The use of the pickle library ensures efficient data storage and retrieval, allowing the system to scale and adapt to user needs. This approach offers real-time recommendations and enhances the user experience with a well-structured web application.
